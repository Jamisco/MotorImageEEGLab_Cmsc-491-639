Hand movements of limbs are located in:  9, 10, 13, 14, and 11 sites of the standard 10/20 international system

We are using CLA paradigm: Classical (CLA) left/right hand motor imagery(MI)

For each of Trial
	- Action signal indicating LH, RH or cicle (passive imagery) is shown for 1 second, during which
		- Subject selects imagery to implement
		- Imagery is implementing by imagining closing and opening the respective fist once
		- Passive imagery means subject did not engage in any voluntary mental imagery until next Trial

	- After implemented imagery, subject waits for next trial

Time
	- 1 second to implement action
	- 1 second wait for stimulus to disappear
	- (1.5 - 2.5) random off duration before next trial

	- 3 seconds on average per trial, 300 trials done, 15 minutes total per segment


- Synchronization 
	- Upon each new presentation of a visual action signal, 
	eGUI forwarded a 500 ms 1 μV pulse signal via the computer’s USB port and Arduino Uno microcontroller to the EEG-1200 X3 bipolar input. 
	The signal was subsequently recorded by Neurofax in the 22nd input channel, 
	appearing in the EEG data record as a series of on/off spikes separated by 500 ms, 
	at the beginning and end of each action signal. 
	This signal was perfectly synchronized with the EEG data and used to align the EEG data samples and the interaction record data maintained by Matlab eGUI.
