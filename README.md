 This is a final project for Cmsc 491/639 Neural Engineering and Instrumentation, University of Maryland, Baltimore County
 
 This project was created by James Mufuh and Lea Menefee

 We have EEG data from 3 different subjects and we peform various analysis on them to see whether we can extract meaning from the data. For example, can we tell the user is using their left or right hand based on their EEG data alone.


We applying various processing and filtering methods in order to sanitize the data

We used the following experiment: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018211

Data for experiment: https://figshare.com/collections/A_large_electroencephalographic_motor_imagery_dataset_for_electroencephalographic_brain_computer_interfaces/3917698

We used data from the CLA experiment, SubjectJ-170508, SubjectJ-170510, Subject-170504

In our files, we renamed these subjects as, SubjectJ, SubjectH, SubjectM respectively
